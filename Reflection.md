A Requirement for CSE143  | 12/11/2020 | Jaden Wang, Justin Banusing, Riley Malone

For the last few weeks of the quarter, we decided to make a smart calorie tracker app called CalTrack that would allow users to track down the different food that they’ve eaten over the past few days, scan food to know its nutritional value and know how many calories they’ve had over the last 24 hours.

Our group came together at the last minute. Justin and Riley met each other through the CSE143 Discord, while Jaden joined in later on through an Ed board posting. It was difficult to collaborate at first due to the difference in time zones, but we were eventually able to make it work. On top of that, many of us were burnt out due to the long, remote quarter.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was the varying levels of experience our members had with our tech stack of choice. A big chunk of our time was just spent going over documentation and lessons for React Native and familiarizing ourselves with what it had to offer. Since we decided to burst through most of the project near the deadline (around Monday), we had to deal with a series of errors that made development difficult. We were able to resolve these by hopping onto a call and doing group debugging. On top of this, working on a mobile app compared to the desktop/web-based applications we’d been working on throughout the quarter was a massive change in pace.

If we were to do the project all over again, we’d reduce our scope to make it more realistic and try to do the work earlier than we did. We stressed out a lot near the end of things because we didn’t expect to run into the problems we faced and underestimated how long some of the components would take. 

Otherwise, we’re pretty happy about how the project turned out results wise.
